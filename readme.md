Nerdschool 
=======================
Nerdschool is an initiative to breach the gap between what you learn at univeristy an what you need in a rel life developer role. It is aimed primarily at students in their first few semesters of Information Technology related degrees but everyone who wants to learn some useful development and coding skills are welcome.


This repository is now defunct, but Nerdschool lives on [here](https://github.com/nerdschoolbergen/)
