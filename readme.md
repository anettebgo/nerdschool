Nerdschool 
=======================
Welcome to Nerdschool - the place to learn some real life programming skills!


What is it?
-----------------------
Nerdschool is a series of exercises teaching tools and techniques commonly used in real software development. School is run by [@anettebgo](https://github.com/anettebgo) and [@sivhollup](http://github.com/sivhollup), with help from [@njanor](https://github.com/njanor) and guests - all professional developers volunteering their time and skills.


Can I come?
-----------------------
Yes!!

We are aiming primarily at students in their first few semesters of Information Technology related degrees but everyone who wants to learn some useful development and coding skills are welcome.


Okay, I want to! When and where?
-----------------------
We run classes every second tuesday during the semester. See this [Meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/Bergen-Nerdschool/) for more info about the next event.


What happens if I miss one?
-------------------------------
Lesson material will be made available on GitHub, and super friendly instructors will help you get up to speed when you come back.


I'm still not convinced...
-------------------------------
Completing all lessons will earn you a signed diploma, that you should mention on your CV. Future employers are going to think better of you due to your demonstrated skills and ability to learn.

Also, it is going to be fun!
