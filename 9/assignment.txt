1) Form groups of about 3 people and review Pub.java in nerdschool.bar (pull from the nerdschool repository on
github). Which code smells can you find? Refactor to remove smell(s). There is a small test suite (nerdschool.bar.PubPricesTest.java)
that will help you along the way. Introduce more tests if you need them.

2) Make three examples of different code smells. Submit them to your git repository and let another group review and
correct your code. Pull someone else's code smells and fix them. Use half the remaining time to make code smells, and
the other half on fixing code.
